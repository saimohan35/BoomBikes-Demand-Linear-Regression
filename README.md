# Boom Bikes Demand Linear Regression
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes wants to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
* How well those variables describe the bike demands

## General Information

# Objective: Building a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes

It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.

## Process followed:
- Data Understanding
- Data Cleaning & Manipulation
- Data Analysis
- Data Preparation: split the data, scaling the features
- Model building: feature selection/elimination based on RFE, p value and VIF
- predictions on training data: residual analysis
- model evaluation on test data

#### Detailed process, plots, Observations and conclusions are provided in python notebook.

## Technologies Used
- pandas version: 2.1.1
- numpy version: 1.24.3
- matplotlib version: 3.8.0
- seaborn version: 0.13.2
